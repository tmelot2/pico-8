	Chained food - multi tiles, sometimes straight, sometimes bent
		- if you eat in right order, GOURANGA!
		- else, it breaks & you don't get bonus
	Countdown before start
	[x] Spawn food inside edges of map
	Don't spawn food on top of each other
	Don't spawn food on player
	Food spoils
	Levels
	Different sized food
	- Snake Dash
		Speed boost (fast ramp up, ease out)
		[x] Can go thru self
		[x] Collect food when dashing thru food
		Bonus if
			Dash thru food
			Collect food on last frame of dash (dash lands on food)
			Dash over self
			Dash land within 1 space of wall or self
			Tony hawk style combos but not super annoying?
		Solves problem of slow early game and opens up movement mid-late game
		Hold and release instead of immediate fire?
			If snake trail colors change over time, hold could bullet time, evident from snake
			colors slowing down
			Hold and release could show end position ghost
		Item pickups?
			Pick up > inventory > push x to use
				Scissors: Next self cross, cut body and clear old
				GPS: Auto turn on wall hit
				Vaccum: Suck in nearby food
		If works, "Snake Dash" good name for game?
	Spawn lines of food for easy fun comboing

	Portal snake, like dash but portals instead, skips over space, can use again later?
